As our enemies increase in sophistication, those protecting our national assets must work together to ensure their intrusion attempts do not succeed. The Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) is one technique that successfully mitigates Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), providing a means for net defenders to obtain and maintain information dominance over cyber threats.
