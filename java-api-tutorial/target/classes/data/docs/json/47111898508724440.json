Using MarkLogic for Cyber Analysis. MarkLogic Server’s features include the ability to quickly obtain analytics against content loaded and indexed with the product. These analytics, derived from in-memory indexes, make queries for this information extremely fast, regardless of data size. These capabilities make MarkLogic an ideal platform for tackling the cyber, “Big Data” problem. For a technology demonstration, Boeing developed a prototype web application using MarkLogic’s built in analytics for summarizing and categorizing network traffic. This presentation will discuss this prototype effort, techniques, and best practices used in the development of this Cyber-Analytic Platform.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Boeing", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Telly Stroumbis", "title":"Technical Fellow"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":3, "contentRating":3}]}
