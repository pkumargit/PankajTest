With engineering, development, and operational support from Raytheon, DCGS is installed in more than 100 global systems and enables the military to access and exploit intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data in real time. Andy Yates and Peter Stewart from Raytheon, will explain the benefits of DCGS, present MarkLogic performance results from a fielding report, and discuss why MarkLogic is a superior choice for the DCGS Integrated Backbone. They will also reveal how a combination of MarkLogic and Hadoop would propel a future cloud-based infrastructure.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Intelligence and Information Systems, Raytheon Company", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Andy Yates", "title":"Engineering Fellow"},{"affiliation":"DCGS-Army Standard Cloud, V3 Raytheon Company", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Peter Stewart", "title":"Technical Lead"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"Interesting talk, but work is still quite preliminary.
