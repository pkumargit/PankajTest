In this presentation we’ll demonstrate how the MarkLogic Office Toolkit lets you do just that – including managing reusable content components, tracking updates to linked content, transforming to other output formats, and leveraging MarkLogic Server’s XML search capabilities. We’ll also dive under the hood to explain both the strengths and limitations of using Word for this purpose, and compare Word and its use of OOXML to traditional structured XML editors. This is a “must-see” presentation for anyone with structured documentation.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Flatirons Solutions", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Rich Schafer", "title":"Director of Consulting"},{"affiliation":"Flatirons Solutions", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Lauren Ward", "title":"Technical Lead"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":3, "contentRating":4}]}
