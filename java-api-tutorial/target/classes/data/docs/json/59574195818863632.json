Security is enforced by mutual authentication along with an external Web Service call to look up user credentials (attributes and\/or role) information. The user’s credentials are then applied during the lifetime of the user’s session. This basically achieves RBAC and ABAC. The ABAC features take advantage of MarkLogic’s dynamic role provisioning and compartment security features. This talk includes a demonstration of one such solution.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Steven Brockman", "title":"Senior Consultant"},{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Thomas Diepenbrock", "title":"Senior Consultant"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"Good examples of how dynamic role provisioning works in XQuery.
