It serves as a gateway to quality information resources, many not available through the \"ordinary\" Web. DigiTop supplies authoritative and reliable published information about agriculture, forestry and allied fields, including government, economics and business, by providing around-the-clock access to key databases, journals, newspapers, statistics, and other important electronic resources that are licensed on behalf of USDA employees. DigiTop uses MarkLogic to provide an enriched searchable content base derived from over 60 million records. In addition, DigiTop’s MarkLogic implementation provides management of “favorites,” content exporting, and highly customizable alerts functionality. The enriched content base makes the DigiTop a one of a kind resource for USDA employees and researchers.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"National Agriculture Library U.S. Department of Agriculture", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Stan Kosecki", "title":"Head Information Services and Collections Branch"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"I worked on this project when I was in Professional Services.
