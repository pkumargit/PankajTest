This presentation will discuss how we solved this problem for lds.org - a high traffic, constantly changing site. We will review our implementation of MarkLogic and how we are using it to do in-context editing, creation of new pages, translation, and publishing. We will demonstrate our use of dynamic forms and walk through code that explains how we are able to create different content types efficiently. We will also show how this functionality is currently being used across ten different projects to publish thousands of documents per week in 10+ languages.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Church of Latter-day Saints ", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Mindie Sorenson", "title":"Senior Engineer"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"Mindy is great", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"Very useful.
