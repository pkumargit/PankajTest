Soon after, when Wiley was planning our replacement platform for InterScience, MarkLogic was selected as a key technology solution for not only as the content store, but also the search engine as well as the application engine for serving more than five million journal articles, 8,000 online books, and 150 reference works now available via Wiley Online Library.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Wiley", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Gregory St. John", "title":"Vice President, Digital Product Strategy"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":3},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":3, "contentRating":4}]}
