After going through this exercise in the previous version of their DAM, Conde Nast has chosen to forgo this path and instead build a custom solution using MarkLogic and the xquerrail framework. This approach allows Conde Nast to build a flexible DAM solution which is tailored to their specific digital asset workflow and new content initiatives. Most importantly, by enabling their development teams to work in an Agile environment and continuously iterate on the DAM, Conde Nast has the flexibility to evolve in an ever changing publishing and media landscape", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Conde Nast", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Brian Cross", "title":"Director, Digital Asset Management "}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":3},{"comments":"Interesting to see the progression of solutions leading to MarkLogic.
