In this two-hour training session we will provide an overview of the Hadoop ecosystem and how it can complement MarkLogic. Using the new MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop, participants will build MapReduce jobs to load and process data in a MarkLogic application. Participants should have Java development experience, but need not have used Hadoop previously. We will provide cloud environments pre-configured with Hadoop and MarkLogic Server.  This is a hands-on session so please bring your laptop.  Space is limited to the first 25 participants.  If you would like to reserve a space in the session, stop by the MarkLogic University Booth at  the Partner Showcase to sign-up.  We will have several laptops available, which may also be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Evan Lenz", "title":"Software Developer, Community "}], "surveys":[{"comments":"Very informative and thought-provoking.", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5}]}
