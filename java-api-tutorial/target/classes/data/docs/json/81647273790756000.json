If you could talk to MarkLogic (with its XML data model) in SQL (which operates over a relational data model), what would that look like? Come hear Dr Mary Holstege describe what she’s working on for a future release of MarkLogic – a way to talk to MarkLogic in SQL over ODBC.\n \nUsing a Relational Databases with MarkLogic \nDavid Lee, MarkLogic\n \nxmlsh provides a simple and efficient way to integrate relational databases to MarkLogic. Using just a few scripting commands, relational data can be extracted from Oracle, Mysql, sqlite etc. and easily preprocessed into XML documents and loaded into a MarkLogic database. Just as easily, MarkLogic can be queried and the results stored into a relational database. Since the processing is all run within a single process, using streaming and multithreading the process is highly efficient and suitable for production enterpise environments, as well as being simple and easy to develop.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Hsiao Su", "title":"Sr. Performance Engineer"},{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"David Lee", "title":"Lead Engineer"},{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Mary Holstege", "title":"Principal Engineer"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"Mary's talk on SQL was great.
