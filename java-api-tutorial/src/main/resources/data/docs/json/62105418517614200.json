The Image Bank allows users to retrieve images by searching caption text or applying filters for chronology, topical area, and other derived search facets within the content. \n    \nIn concert with Yuxi Pacific, OSA intends to develop the product to eventually include more than 1 million images, taking advantage of several innovative features within MarkLogic 5, including build-ins for managing binary content and advanced search faceting and indexing.
