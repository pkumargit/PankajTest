We have to maintain consistency among related documents to reuse or utilize them, but it is a painful and time-consuming task. Our solution called “Terasoluna-DS” enables automated consistency check among Excel-documents by using XML and MarkLogic Server. In addition, because of its capability to search the relation between source code and design document, it can be useful for AMO. We have utilized this solution for documentation in a system integration project (for one of our clients in finance sector) and expanding this business. In this session, we will explain “the details of automated consistency check” and “how to handle Excel documents in various formats.”", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"NTT Data", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Takashi Okada", "title":"Manager, Business Intelligence"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"Good use of mark logic improve quality presentation was a little dry", "speakerRating":3, "contentRating":3},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":3, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5}]}
