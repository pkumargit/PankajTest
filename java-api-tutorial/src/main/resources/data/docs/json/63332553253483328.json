Initially a print-only publisher, the Church currently publishes content in multiple forms and languages, through multiple channels. Publishing is shifting from a single channel publishing model to an integrated multi-channel publishing approach. To facilitate this paradigm change, the Church is developing a Digital Content Supply Chain. The supply chain is both a strategy and an integration of solutions to enable the creation, editing, translation, enrichment and publishing of content through multiple channels. This presentation is an overview of the supply chain strategy, the major business drivers and key areas, and the tool sets employed for implementation.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Eric Michie", "title":"Product Manager"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"Great speaker, focused presentation; lessons\/issues applicable way beyond religious institutions (which he rightly pointed out).", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5}]}
