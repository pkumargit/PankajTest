Academic libraries struggle with managing the terabytes of data they acquire and generate as they engage in large-scale digitization projects and purchase large collections of digital content. This content includes not only electronic articles and books, but also digitized video and audio, geospatial resources, including vector and image data, and numeric statistical data.  \n \nTo deal with this new data challenge, academic libraries in Ontario, Canada, have pooled resources to build a new set of shared services for over 400,000 students and researchers called Scholars Portal. This session will describe how MarkLogic has become the core technology behind this new digital library.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"University of Toronto", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Alan Darnell", "title":"Director of Scholars Portal"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":3, "contentRating":3},{"comments":"Great stuff but a little long, slightly too much content\n", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":5}]}
