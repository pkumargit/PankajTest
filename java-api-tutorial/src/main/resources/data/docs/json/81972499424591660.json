The REST endpoints expose the vast majority of MarkLogic's most popular indexes and features, but in a way that you as the developer can author your app in the language of your choosing.  We'll talk first about the Corona project: a community-sponsored, open-source, RESTful interface library available today. Then we'll give a preview of what's being developed for a future MarkLogic release.\n ", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Jason Hunter", "title":"Deputy CTO"},{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Colleen Whitney", "title":"Lead Engineer"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"I'm really excited about the REST interface and Jason and Colleen did a great job explaining it.
