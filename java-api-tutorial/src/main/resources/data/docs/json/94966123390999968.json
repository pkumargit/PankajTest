The cost of maintaining three heterogeneous systems is high. Not only do staff members need to navigate different operating systems, programming languages, and applications, but patrons have to work with data fragmented across silos. This session will describe how Princeton Seminary is replacing all three systems with MarkLogic Server. We will describe with practical examples and cautionary tips how libraries can use the MarkLogic Server to move from heterogeneous data silos to a unified digital environment.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Princeton Theological Seminary", "bio":"Clifford B.
