In this talk we will explore tuning techniques and configurations used to reach this throughput. While you might not be able to use all of these tricks on your next project, even one or two of them can make a big difference. We will also explore tuning techniques used to implement a challenging workload involving real-time aggregate calculations saved back into the database. Similar throughput results were achieved.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Hsiao Su", "title":"Sr. Performance Engineer"},{"affiliation":"MarkLogic", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Lee Pollington", "title":"Principal Consultant"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"Need more presentations like this", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"Nice view under the hood how the server manages document inserts.", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"So much nformation.
