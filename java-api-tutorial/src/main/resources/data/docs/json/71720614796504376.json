In the age of Big Data our ability to keep up with the unrelenting pace of change and innovation will be challenged in ways we can't even begin to imagine.  Our behaviors, experiences, identities, and nearly every aspect of our lives will become part of a vast real-time repository in the cloud, creating limitless opportunities for innovation. How will we harness the power of Big Data? How will it redefine your business and your job? And what about the disruptive role of the Cloud and Social Media? It's an overwhelming mixture of changes, but it's also an opportunity to reshape the way we innovate in business and society, perhaps enabling us to tackle some of the world's biggest problems. Join Tom as he takes us on a journey through this new landscape and new generation of behaviors and expectations about how we collaborate, work, play, and experience the world.\n \nTom Koulopoulos, leader, futurist, and author of nine business books on the intersection of business and technology, including his latest book Cloud Surfing, is uniquely qualified to help us understand the impact of technology.
