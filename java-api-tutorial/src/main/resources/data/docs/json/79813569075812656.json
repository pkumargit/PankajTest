A user-friendly search engine needs to be able to infer as much as possible from a simple query in order to give the user as specific and complete result set as possible. This session will demonstrate XQuery strategies developed at Jones McClure Publishing for transforming user queries into more intelligent queries that leverage content-specific markup for speed and accuracy without additional input from the user. The presentation will give an overview of the basic templates and present several examples of real world implementations that enhance usersâ€™ search experience and improve the quality of results.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Jones McClure Publishing", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"Will Thompson", "title":"Chief Software Engineer"}], "surveys":[{"comments":"Learned a bit more about the search API but use case didn't resonate for me", "speakerRating":2, "contentRating":2},{"comments":"Great to see a good hands-on presentation with practical tips and tricks balanced with architectural guidance.
