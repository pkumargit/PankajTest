In most enterprises there are a collection of systems, both legacy and new, which own and manage different workflows, content and data services. Often they do not work well together and are difficult to integrate at a technical and business level. How do you manage the differences between these systems and regain a simple enterprise view? This session will describe the role of MarkLogic and other technologies in building a powerful architectural approach to using Structured and Unstructured Content Stores, Metadata and Semantic Technology.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"Press Association", "bio":"", "email":"", "name":"John O'Donovan", "title":"Director of Technology "}], "surveys":[{"comments":"A hugely entertaining and informative presentation - thanks John!", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":4},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":4, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"Very engaging", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5},{"comments":"", "speakerRating":3, "contentRating":3},{"comments":"great presentation", "speakerRating":5, "contentRating":5}]}
