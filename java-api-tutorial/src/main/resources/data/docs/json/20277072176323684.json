The IACP’s primary mission is to serve the needs of law enforcement. Part of this mission is executed through groundbreaking research. Scott Brien and Steve Fender are exploring the potential for the development of a new IACP application with MarkLogic to analyze data about officers who are injured or killed in the line of duty. This application will aggregate data from various state and federal law enforcement agencies, analyze the data to answer research questions, and discover hidden trends in how and why police officers are injured and killed in the line of duty – leading to policy changes to enhance the safety of officers nationwide.", "speakers":[{"affiliation":"International Association of Chiefs of Police", "bio":"Scott is a Project Manager at the National Center for the Prevention of Violence Against the Police ", "email":"", "name":"Scott Brien", "title":"Project Manager"},{"affiliation":"International Association of Chiefs of Police", "bio":"Steve is a Project Coordinator at the National Center for the Prevention of Violence Against the Police, International Association of Chiefs of Police", "email":"", "name":"Steve Fender", "title":"Project Coordinator"}], "surveys":[]}
